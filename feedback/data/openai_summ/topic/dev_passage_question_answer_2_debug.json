{"text": "Striped whipsnake\n\nThe STRIPED WHIPSNAKE (_Masticophis taeniatus_) is a species of nonvenomous snake in the family Colubridae. It is closely related to the California whipsnake (_Masticophis lateralis_). The striped whipsnake is native to the western United States and adjacent northern Mexico.\n\n\nIdentification\n\nThe striped whipsnake is approximately 30-72 inches (76–183 cm) in total length (including tail). This snake exhibits black, dark brown, or gray coloration on its back, often with an olive or bluish tint. Along the center of each of the first four rows of pale dorsal scales, is a dark longitudinal stripe. There is a white to cream-colored stripe down its side that is bisected by either a solid or dashed black line. The coloring on the snake's belly tends to be cream to yellowish, fading to white toward the head, and coral pink toward the tail. This snake also features a lower preocular between the upper labial scales of the mouth. The anal scale is divided.\n\n\nGeographic range\n\nThe striped whipsnake is found throughout the western United States and northern Mexico. The northernmost part of its geographic range is in south central Washington, and continues southward into the Great Basin between the Cascade-Sierran crest and the continental divide. Its range then continues southeast across the continental divide into New Mexico and western and central Texas. The southernmost part of its range lies in Michoacán, Mexico. In the Western United States its range also extends outside of the Great Basin into the Rogue River Valley in southwestern Oregon and northern California. There is a population in Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah.\n\n\nHabitat\n\nThe striped whipsnake is commonly found in a wide variety of habitats including shrub lands, grasslands, sagebrush flats, canyons, piñon-juniper woodlands, and open pine-oak forests. It is attracted to both permanent and seasonal rocky streams, and it frequents both flatlands and mountains.\n\n\nBehavior\n\nThe species _M. taeniatus_ is diurnal, active during the day, and is very alert and fast moving. It seeks shelter in rock outcrops, small mammal burrows, as well as in trees and shrubs depending on the habitat they occupy. This snake is nonvenomous, but it preys on a wide variety of species including lizards, other snakes (including venomous rattlesnakes), small mammals, young birds, frogs, and insects.\n\n\nReproduction\n\nLittle is known about the reproductive activities of _M. taeniatus_. After fertilization the female striped whipsnake will lay a clutch of 3-12 eggs, between the months of June and July, usually in an abandoned rodent burrow. One study has shown a natural incubation period of 44 to 58 days.\n\n\nSubspecies\n\nThere are two subspecies of _Masticophis taeniatus_ which are recognized as being valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.[1]\n\n-   _Masticophis taeniatus girardi_ [2]\n-   _Masticophis taeniatus taeniatus_\n\n_Nota bene_: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than _Masticophis_.\n\n\nEtymology\n\nThe subspecific name, _girardi_, is in honor of French-American herpetologist Charles Frédéric Girard.[3]\n\n[1] \n\n[2] \n\n[3] Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). _The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles_. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (_Masticophis taeniatus girardi_, p. 101).\n\n\nQuestion: Answer the following question based on the above passage:\n\nIs the striped whipsnake dangerous to human beings?\n\nAnswer: Since the striped whipsnake is not venomous, it is not as dangerous to people as venomous snakes. However, it can still reach a length of 183cm, which means it can still cause harm to infants and small children. Overall, it cannot be considered to be dangerous to humans.", "summary": ["Since the striped whipsnake is not venomous, it is not as dangerous to people as venomous snakes. "]}
