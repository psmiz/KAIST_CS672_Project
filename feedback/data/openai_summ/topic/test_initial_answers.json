He is an old man and he has been alone for what seems to be longer than imaginable. The sunspiders, his companions, die separately in their own heat. No thought is given to their longevity past one season. The main character does not age, but can still be damaged. Already he is injured from the tumble he took in this tale, after and time of hunting around deathly oven of the sunspiders joining together and using their power to send his consciousness up to near space. \n\nNow he is at the bottom of the outcropping, leaving a tumble trail of dried blood. The Sunspiders crawl up every single night, layer each other in a ballance of multicolored light, and focus them all on the old man, setting him ablaze. The old man, in his broken state, doesn't feel horror, but even more curiousity what their actions would mean. After he dies, they all scatter, the connected light dissipates, and they disperse to lay dormant. Apparently, it all means burying the old man.", "The primary tension of the story is a desire to understand the world and its history while simultaneously realizing that there might be nothing left to be discovered. The protagonist feels a connection to the Sunspiders, which has become their primary provider of light and power. However, as time goes on, it becomes increasingly clearer that this may be the only thing of its kind left in the world. The protagonist unexpectedly finds evidence of human remnants, but then realizes that these are likely from the past, and not the present. This leaves them feeling momentarily content, but ultimately alone and without answers. The Sunspiders then come to the rescue, providing them with a final send-off and closure.", "The primary source of tension throughout the story is that the narrator cannot locate a lost civilization (possibly). This is a source of frustration for the narrator because it is implied that this civilization may have had valuable artifacts that the narrator could collect. This is why the narrator hopes to find a remnant from before the change of human life that tried to survive. The ants are used to situate the story into the future, because the narrator wants to know if humans are still present and alive in this period, because it feels like they still have purpose.\n\nIn the last paragraphs of the story, it is revealed that the narrator has memory of water, and the setting of this story is recontextualized because the current story is conveyed in images that the protagonist absorbs and then utilizes that information to recreate images of his/her own imagining. This leads to clumps of Sunspiders becoming like a lens while they adjust to a plan and then focus the sun on the narrator.

So, it is implied that the Sunspiders worshipped the instructions and the performer of the rites of their own intentions.", "The narrator describes how they believe that when they were younger they once were able to visualize the changes that have happened, as they were able to view clouds. As they grew older, they were not able to visualize the changes any more. This means that they were not able to do so by visualizing them in their mind, as one might with a specific image like a cloud. Considering the Sunspiders were able to digest the corpse of the narrator and the Sunspiders were able to reflect enough light to help create a funeral pyre, this shows that the Sunspiders are able to manipulate the light in their bodies in ways that the narrator was no longer able to.", "Seeing something left behind from when the narrator was not alone is one of their main hopes but the narrator does not.

However, in the end, they must believe that the spiders mark their demise-whether the spiders are real or not, because there is no other way out of the cave but to become dust. ", "The narrator seems driven by their sense of connection to the Sunspiders, and through that, connection to the world around them. They love the idea of contributing to the next generation and preserving themselves on a much grander scale through the Sunspiders. In their barren world, they have relied on the Sunspiders to be a focal point that connects them. When the Sunspiders begin to arrange themselves in a pattern above the narrator, they create a light show, and this final gift motivates the narrator to continue on their journey. The heat, the risk to their body, and the idea of the end being their funeral pyre keep the narrator going. Their goal is to find something that connects them to the world before, and the Sunspiders help them find an accessible connection.", "The Sunspiders begin grouping into several large clusters.

He expressed his disinterest for his assignment to the attending officer as he always does. He thinks his job is a waste of time and resources. He is dressed in full uniform, has to have a special security clearance and works in a secret area of a heavily guarded military facility. He was prepared for another uneventful night of watching nothing happen on the monitors.\n\nAt 1:07 pm, some of the sensors started to detect something in a pocket of seemingly empty space about 17 light years away. One sensor detects an emission of gamma rays, another one detected x rays. This caught Hunter's attention as it is unusual for an area of empty space to emit such radiation. Hunter decided to take a look at the area with telescopes. He sent instructions an an infrared, visible light, and a radio telescope to survey the area. He was perplexed that both of them showed absolutely nothing even though the radiation levels were reaching levels that were theorized to be the upper limit of what the most powerful stars could emit. Because the telescopes couldn't see anything, Hunter was looking at data that told him a massive amount of radiation was either appearing out of nothing, or leaking into our universe. Hunter decoded that he would restart the sensors and receiving satellites to try and make sure these weren't false readings.\n\nAs he was waiting for the sensors to come back on, the infrared telescope he pointed at the area gave an alert. It had detected a momentary spike and drop to normal of heat in the area, which did not match the ever increasing readings from the other sensors. Hunter hoped the sensors would come back on, show nothing, and he could submit a simple sensor anomaly report to his superiors. These hopes were crushed when the sensors started returning information again. Not only did they pick up the radiation again, they were maxed out. Hunter couldn't believe it. He stared in awe, unable to come up with any explanation for what was going on in front of his eyes. Moments later, all the telescopes started giving alerts. The visible light telescope detected light levels akin to a supernova 100 light years away. The radio telescope was showing what could best be described as trying to broadcast every radio station from one antenna. The infrared telescope was telling him that this area of space, empty a few minutes ago, was engulfed in flames.\n\nThen it all stopped. Everything observing the anomaly stopped transmitting data. Hunter thought it was an issue with the receiving satellites, however a check revealed they were functioning properly. He tried restarting the sensors and telescopes, but simply could not get any data from them. Hunter decided this was unusual enough to report to the officers and senior scientists at the base.\n\nHe called an emergency meeting, having to wake up generals, astronomers, and physicists in the middle of the night. He thought that his news wouldn't be well received at such a time, however his training told him to go through with the protocol right away. After everyone had been assembled and lots of coffee had been consumed, hunter began to present the data and his recollection of the events. He was surprised as the others began to look horrified.\n\nOne of the generals pointed at Hunter and said \"Just to be clear son, you can never tell anyone outside this room what you just told us\". He then excused hunter from his post, and told him that he would file his honorable discharge papers immediately if Hunter wished to leave the force. \"Did I just detect something from out of this world?\" Hunter asked the general, to which one of the physicists replied in a solemn tone \"Out of this universe\".", "No answer", "' the lady\u2019s nightly ritual of filling the tub with Dove\u2019s Double Power Calming bubble bath, taking a Valium, and washing it down with a smooth Bud from the fridge' means she is sleepy and has some kind of alcohol (she favors Bud) before she hits the sack.

What is interesting is that typically the Libertarian party accounts for about one percent of the vote, but this year, Sharpe is coming in second only to the formidable Gov.

It seems that Sharpe makes for a formidable contender because he is rallying on social media, a grouping of social media platforms that appeal to the younger voters-who are more eager to see change on the political landscape. Third party voters have been disgruntled with the stolid old guard in politics in both Republican and Democratic parties, but it seems that the former has had a particularly rough time aligning their moral and social values with the more progressive perspectives that are much more common amongst younger voters.
