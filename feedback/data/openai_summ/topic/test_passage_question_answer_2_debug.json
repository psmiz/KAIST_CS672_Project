{"text": "[RO] Summer\n\nJeffery was sitting in his statistics class nodding away as the information was simply passing by him. He could hardly wait to get out of class. Mondays, and Fridays were fine because there was a small chance of him seeing her. However, on Wednesdays she was always on time. He could see it now walking out from his this room strolling down Taylor Mall. Casually looking over to his right, and there she would be in a sunflower dress with dark hair writing in her journal. He could feel it now the sun beating down on him, and the wind tickling his skin. Jeffery would spend hours every day imagining how he would ask her to a date.  Perhaps Coffee, no she wouldn’t like coffee it’s obvious she likes tea. The courage he needed wasn’t there; he couldn’t talk to girls especially beautiful ones like her. The clock was ticking away, and the professor closed his book with a loud thud. Everyone got up, and started to leave. Jeffery was so deep into though that he didn’t hear class was over so early. Looking at the clock he knew he had time to stroll around in the building. She wouldn’t be there until 12:30. \nJeffery walked out and down the hall to his right. Ahead of him was the journalist building. He thought why not pop on by, and see what they were up to. He fixed his tie, and walked in. The building was much more impressive than the criminal justice one. Newly remolded it held three floors, and a news station on top. All of the students were moving around through the building all dressed nice, and talking about current events. College always had the optimistic feel to it especially on Wednesdays. Jeffery looked around the room. I may as well take a seat, I still have ten minutes. He sat there and opened up his favorite book, and started to read. Behind him he could hear the television blaring news programs. Another new part of the build was a massive projector showing news around the clock. Give me a good book any day. \nHe wasn’t a page in when he heard “Some of the most difficult of challenges is taking the first step.” \nJeffery turned kept listening. “We have to fight for what we want, and never take no for answer. Today may be the last day we have on earth.” Jeffery was feeling something moving inside of him, a strange inspiration. “So with this last day we will love like there is no tomorrow, fight like there is no tomorrow, and live like there is no tomorrow.” YES, Jeffery thought yes that’s right I have to tell her. He turns around to see where this new motivation comes from. On the scene is black and the words come up “Ford.” Why do car commercials always have the best inspiration? His watch started to beep he looked down 12:25. This was it he was about to see her. He got up, but the inspiration he felt still lingered with him. His breathing picked up, and he started to walk at a brisk pace. This was something different this was something new. He was going to ask her to a date today. He was actually going to talk to her. He started moving faster and faster almost running to the door. He quickly opens it. I’m going to do it I can do it. He rounds the corner to Taylor mall and stops to look for her. In his excitement he began to frantically search. She wasn’t on the grass like she normally was, or on any of the benches. He felt the need to keep looking. It was Wednesday she had to be here. There was no mistake she wasn’t here. He went over to where she normally sat a small group of people were there talking. \n“Excuse me, have you seen a pretty girl with long dark hair in a Sun Flower dress?”\nThey looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders. One of the other girls sitting there spoke up to Jeffery, “What’s her name?”\nHis face went white. In all of the time that he had been dreaming about her he never knew her name. He began to run down Taylor mall in embarrassment. He reached the edge of the street. Defeated, and broken he would get on the train back to his small dorm. Today college, and Wednesday lost their hopeful optimism.  Jeffery reached back to get his train card, and realized that his wallet was missing. Perfect as if today couldn’t get any worse. He started to head back to the journalist building where he thought he lost it. We walked in, and climbed up the stairs. He got to his couch, and saw no wallet. His heart sank again. He lost his wallet, lost hope of asking the most beautiful girl out on a date, and embarrassed himself doing it. He turned to walk home when he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned to see the prettiest girl with long dark hair in a sunflower dress standing there. He felt his heart jump for joy, and he said “Hello”\n“Your Jeffery Snipe right? I have your Wallet.”\nHe reached out and grabbed it brushing her hand he felt his heart melt some. “T-thank you, I’m Jeffery”\nShe smiled warmly “Jeff… I am Summer.” She paused for a moment looking at him warmly,  “can I tell you something Jeff?”\nJeff still bewildered nodded. Summer looked away then back at him “It might sound creepy but every Wednesday at 12:30 I wait for you to come out of class so I can see your smiling face, but I have never had the courage to ask you to a date.”\n\n\nQuestion: Answer the following question based on the above passage:\n\nWhat does the text say about Summer?\n\nAnswer: Summer is a student in Jeffery's statistics class. She is a beautiful girl with long dark hair and a sunflower dress. Every Wednesday at 12:30, she waits for Jeffery to come out of class so she can see his smiling face. However, she has never had the courage to ask him to a date.", "summary": ["Summer is a student in Jeffery's statistics class. Jeffrey has a crush on her.

{"text": "[MF] The Stag\n\n\nBefore time existed, there was a forest. No animals lived in the forest, &amp; one ever entered the forest. It remained silent &amp; still for eons. \nThat is of course, until one rainy night. A raindrop, just like any other raindrop, hit the ground. More &amp; more raindrops fell, and a puddle appeared. From the puddle, a small, chubby hand reached out. It grabbed the dirt &amp; pulled itself out. The small hand was attracted to a young girl. \nShe blinked. \nIn front of her stood thin, spindly trees. They were golden, like the harp strings whom’s music echos faintly in her mind.\nSilence &amp; rain. \nNo more rain. \nSilence.\nA flash of white fur struck the corner of her eye. \nSuddenly there in front of her stood a stag. \n\n“Hello?” The little girl trembled. \nThe stag stood watching. Then, it lowered it’s head. It’s eyes were as black as obsidian. \nIt placed it’s head in her arms. “I made you, &amp; I will keep you safe.” The stag said, “I love you very much.” \n\n“What is your name?” She asked.\n\n“I am who I am,” the stag bellowed, “I will call you Lucy.” \n\n“I like the name Lucy. You are very beautiful Mr. Stag.” \n\nThe rain, which had stopped briefly, returned. \n\n“Walk with me, Lucy.” The Stag stomped the ground, &amp; an umbrella emerged. \n\n\nLucy grabbed it, &amp; winced slightly at the sudden pause of rain. \n\nShe got up, &amp; neared the Stag. She held his on to him to keep herself steady.\n\n\nThey walked for a minutes, or hours, or seconds. No one could really be sure. “I wish to be like you, Mr Stag. You are so lovely with your white fur.” \n\n“You don’t know what you ask.” \n\nHowever long they were walking, the trees were now as large as the pillars from the heaven Lucy came from, but no longer recalls.\n\nThe Stag laid down to rest, &amp; beckoned Lucy to come rest with him. \n\nAs he laid down to rest, Lucy took a piece of his horn, and used it to cut off his flesh, which she wrapped over herself. Lucy was now covered in rich, soft white fur. \nWhen the Stag awoke, he noticed his fur was gone, and he was naked. He knew what had happened.\nThis cursed Lucy to be a doe of mere flesh and bone, condemned to die. \nTime was set into motion. Death was the first clock. \nLucy hid from the stag till her death.\n\n\nThe Stag found Lucy three hundred &amp; sixty five days later while he was rounding the forest. He was crushed. \n\nHe decided to call her demise a year.\nHe was so moved, he decided to lay down by her one last time. He fell into a deep sleep.\nThe trees, saw the Stag’s mourning. They were crushed, because they felt the pure love the Stag had for his creation.\nThe trees mourned as well. They rid themselves of their leaves, turning them into a blood red, before they fell off. This was the first time they had done anything so risky. The Stag would later call this Fall. \n\n\nWhen the Stag woke up, the sky was sunny &amp; blue. The trees were full of leaves &amp; heavy with a bright red fruit. He walked up to one &amp; tasted it. The fruit was sweet. he called it an apple. \nThat’s when the Stag saw him. \n\nThe boy jumped. He had just opened his eyes. In front of him was the corpse of a deer, long dead and rotting. \nA few paces behind the rotting deer, stood a stag. \nThe Stag looked at the boy. His empty skull showing no expression. \n\n“A-are you Death? Did you kill that deer?” The boy asked.\n\n“No I am not death,” the stag answered. \n\n“Who are you?” \n\n“I am a friend. May I sit with you?” \n\n\nThe boy glanced warily at the Stag for several moments before nodding.\n“You May call me Ternate,” said the Stag,” for I am the sky, the forest’s trees, &amp; this stag.”\n\n\n“You’re the sky? I came from the sky, I think,” the boy pointed upward,” can I have an apple?” Ternate nodded. \n\n“Ternate, are you sure you aren’t death? You seem very scary.” \n\n\nThe Stag, realizing that he was currently nothing but bones, shook the trees down, and dressed himself in leaves. \nThey sat together, until the sun set. \nThe boy eyed Lucy. \n\n\n“Am I going to die like that deer, Ternate?”\nThe stag looked over at Lucy’s body, seeing himself in her fur. \n\n“I don’t know. Only time will tell.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“Can we go somewhere else? It’s getting dark.”\n\nThe stag nodded, lifting its heavy frame up from where it sat. \nThe Stag walked up to Lucy one last time and pressed his forehead to hers. The ground opened up and took her in. \nThe leaves the stag wore turned back to white fur.\nWithout hesitating, the boy’s eyes lit up “You’re beautiful, Mr. Stag.”\n\nQuestion: Answer the following question based on the above passage:\n\nDiscuss the setting of the story.\n\nAnswer: This story is set in a forest from before time existed until the present day. The forest remained silent for ages until one rainy night, when a raindrop gave birth to the first creature; a small, chubby hand pulled itself out of a pool of rainwater. The creature was drawn to a young girl, who led them both (the creature and the young girl) to find an elusive-yet-endearing creature, the stag. The stag is the only being in the forest, and the source of the physical, natural, and mystical phenomena that exists there. The woods are depicted as being magical and mysterious. The setting provides a distinctly mystical and magical feeling.", "summary": ["This story is set in a forest from before time existed. The woods are depicted as being magical and mysterious.
