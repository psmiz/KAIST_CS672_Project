He is known for his fundamental contributions to the fields of complex networks and complex systems, for which he was awarded the 2014 Lagrange Prize.\n\n\nCareer\n\nMark Newman grew up in Bristol, England, where he was a pupil at Bristol Cathedral School, and earned both an undergraduate degree and a PhD in physics from the University of Oxford, before moving to the United States to conduct research first at Cornell University and later at the Santa Fe Institute, a private research institute in northern New Mexico devoted to the study of complex systems. In 2002 Newman moved to the University of Michigan, where he is currently the Anatol Rapoport Distinguished University Professor of Physics and a professor in the university's Center for the Study of Complex Systems.\n\n\nResearch\n\nNewman is known for his research on complex networks, and in particular for work on collaboration patterns of scientists, random graph theory, assortative mixing, community structure, percolation theory, and network epidemiology.[1] He was also co-inventor, with Michael Gastner, of a method for generating density-equalizing maps or cartograms, which forms the foundation for the Worldmapper web site. Their work gained attention following the 2004 US presidential election when it was used as the basis for a widely circulated map of the election results, which adjusted the size of states based on their population to give a more accurate sense of how many voters voted for each party.[2][3]\n\nNewman's network-based methods have been applied to a variety of fields, including psychology, sociology, economics and biology. The same basic methods have accurately predicted a wide variety of results, from relationships between organisms in an ecosystem to associations between terrorist organizations.[4] Newman has also studied the risk of forest fires[5] and the social behavior of dolphins in New Zealand,[6] as well as the structure of the scientific community itself.[7]\n\nNewman has worked on power-law distributions in complex systems, including in the distribution of wealth, the sizes of cities, and the frequency of words in languages (see Zipf's Law).[8] With collaborators Aaron Clauset and Cosma Shalizi, Newman developed statistical methods for analyzing power-law distributions and applied them to the study of a wide range of systems, in various cases either confirming or denying the existence of previously claimed power-law behaviors.[9]\n\nNewman's paper “The structure and function of complex networks”[10] received the most citations of any paper in mathematics between 2001 and 2011.[11]\n\n\nAwards and honors\n\nIn 2007, Newman was elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS).[12] In 2011 and 2012, he received a Faculty Recognition Award and an Excellence in Education Award, both from the University of Michigan. In 2014, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), received the 2014 Lagrange Prize from the ISI Foundation, and was the fifth recipient of the Zachary Karate Club CLUB prize.[13] In 2016, he was elected as a Simons Fellow in Theoretical Physics and received a Guggenheim Fellowship.[14]\n\n[1] Mark Newman's home page\n\n[2] \n\n[3] \n\n[4] \n\n[5] \n\n[6] \n\n[7] \n\n[8] \n\n[9] \n\n[10] \n\n[11] \n\n[12] Curriculum vitae, retrieved 2016-07-01.\n\n[13] Zachary Karate Club CLUB prize, retrieved 2016-07-01.\n\n[14] Guggenhiem Fellowship, retrieved 2016-07-01.\n\n\nQuestion: Answer the following question based on the above passage:\n\nSummarize the awards and honors Newman received. \n\nAnswer: Mark Newman has received multiple awards and honors, including the Anatol Rapoport Distinguished University Professor of Physics at the University of Michigan, the 2014 Lagrange Prize, and two University of Michigan awards.

{"text": "The Legend of King Colossus (short story written for school)\n\n“Gather ‘round, children. I’m going to tell you the story of the Mighty King Colossus”, Grandma Eleanor announced. She had loved telling her grand-daughters her stories, and they quite enjoyed her tales.\n\t\nMary, the oldest of her sisters, playfully urged her other siblings to the bench around their grandma. “But Grandma, have you not already told us this one?” Maggie, the youngest sister, pointed out. “Do you not want to hear it, dear?” she responded. “No, we do!” the middle sister, Lily, giggled. The old woman sat in front of them, ready to tell the family fable. The three children’s eyes grew wide in waiting. Green, hazel, and brown. They had such pretty eyes. Their attention grew, and she began:\n\nOnce, long ago in a castle much like ours lived the Great King Colossus. He was a kind and powerful ruler, and was given a name to be remembered for centuries. One fateful day, the Kind and his Queen were in the courtyard, playing with their two children. Everything was perfect. No wars to be fought, the soft whistle of the wind swaying through the tall grass, and the calm, blissful sound of the river flowing nearby. But, things were soon about to get very weary for the King. A messenger rode up to him, knelt before his majesty, and held out a letter. The King opened it and read aloud; “To King Colossus, \nYour time as king has run out. I send this message to you as but a forewarning. For come sunrise, you will die with my blade in your heart. It will happen in the woods.\nSigned, Zenoriah. You have until nightfall.”\n\t\nThe King was astonished. Zenoriah, the much feared King of Fire who sought to destroy him and his kingdom, had threatened them. But he would not stand by and let him succeed in his mission. And so, he set out to fight the final battle. But, his family refused to leave his side.\n\t\n“I won’t stay waiting for a second dreading your death. If you are to go, let us, your own family, stand by your side.” With great defeated argument, he accepted, but they needed to be well hidden. And so, they ventured off into the forest together, searching for the fiery fiend. It was nearly nightfall when he appeared. But before the King could encounter him, the Queen stopped him. “Take this rose of the faeries, my love”, she said, “and be granted a second life.” The faeries had been known for blessing precious items, ensuring another life, fortune, luck, and other sorts. He was struck. But in return, he handed her a bottle. In the bottle was water from the famed Fountain of Youth. The King had collected it on one of his first voyages, years ago. “Take this, my Queen, and be granted eternal life.” Tears started to form in her eyes as her husband ran his fingers through her flowing, butterscotch hair. They were running out of time, and she and her children ducked under a well hidden cave opening. He then turned to face his enemy. Zenoriah’s black eyes stared menacingly at him. No sign of a soul, just cold pits of darkness. “I’ve been waiting”, he cackled. His voice was like a hissing snake. “I’d thought you wouldn’t make it. But, can’t miss your going-away party, can you?” And with those words, they both unsheathed their swords. The King wielded a blade forged in the very tunnels of Crystal Pass. But Zenoriah, his sword was created in what were probably the very pits of Hell. What with its burning, metal surface. Sparks flew into the air as his enemy’s ember blade crashed against his own. And in a sudden clang, his sword was broken. The fire of Zenoriah’s had melted through it. His shield was his only hope. \n\t\nEvery blow from the evil in front of him into his shield inched him closer and closer to the thundering waterfall. It was dangerous to be this close for the King, but even more for Zenoriah. The water would extinguish his flaming skin. In a single swing, the King went tumbling down the edge. He clutched for dear life on the wet rocks, his fingers slipping. It was too late. Or was it? As his hands were about to give way, he grabbed Zenoriah and pulled. They both plummeted into the dark water below. It was over. Or so he thought. He had transformed into a hawk, the symbol of his kingdom. His second life had been granted. His family was still hiding in the small cave, waiting for his return. After no sign, they emerged from inside. They thought that the worst had come, but all thought of that vanished when King Colossus flew overhead, and dropped the very rose down into the Queen’s hand. The royal family was absolutely euphoric to see that he was alive. But alas, he could no longer be with them. He was now a spirit guardian, and was responsible for watching all over the land. In his loving memory, they planted a towering oak tree. And to this very day, King Colossus flies high, watching over the land.\n\t\n“That’s my favorite story”, uttered Lily when her grandma had stopped. She nodded, and directed the children inside. Once out of view, she turned to face an oak tree, in her hands a rose. She placed it on the ground, and looked up to see a hawk resting on a branch. “Farewell, my love”, she tenderly smiled at it. And as she walked away, the bird responded, “And to you as well, my Queen.”\n\n\nQuestion: Answer the following question based on the above passage:\n\nWhat does the story say about King Zenoriah?\n\nAnswer: The story tells that King Zenoriah is a dangerous and ruthless opponent as he seeks to kill King Colossus and end his reign. The King's family stands by him, despite knowing that defeat is looming. Even after Zenoriah defeats the King and sends him plummeting into a waterfall, the King is able to transform into a hawk and restart his life. King Zenoriah cannot be killed either, but is instead a spirit guardian.", "summary": ["The story tells that King Zenoriah is a dangerous and ruthless opponent as he seeks to kill King Colossus and end his reign.", "The story tells that King Zenoriah, the King of Fire, is a dangerous and ruthless opponent as he seeks to kill King Colossus and end his reign.

He also wields a sword that may have been forged in the very pits of Hell. King Zeonriah's weakness is water, and he presumably perished when King Colossus dragged him down to the bottom of a waterfall during their battle. \n\n"]}

She started it!'\" said Munro, laughing. \"Suzi's the one who pushes me to do it. She says, 'You know you always love it when the kids come by.'\"\n\nOn Saturday, Munro and his buddy Tony Zelinsky of Brewerton finished building a gigantic dragon skeleton in the front yard of Munro and Campanaro's house at 107 Sandra Dr. in North Syracuse.\n\n[]\n\nStan Munro, Suzi Campanaro and Tony Zelinsky created the dragon skeleton Halloween display at 107 Sandra Dr., North Syracuse. Photo by Katrina Tulloch.\n\nThe skeleton, made from hundreds of pieces of cheap particle board, wood paneling and Masonite hardboard, took about a week to complete.\n\n\"This year wasn't expensive at all; most of it is recycled wood from previous projects,\" Munro said. \"We keep our costs down and labor is free. Tony gets paid in steak.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 6, Munro wore a (human) skeleton T-shirt as he repainted black teeth onto the dragon's skull.\n\nGauzy porch screens drape the wing bones and catch the light as the sun goes down. A 14-bone rib cage, tall enough to walk underneath, tapers down to a massive tail which extends around the entire lawn and wraps around a tree.\n\n\"If we're going to make a dragon, we might as well use the whole yard,\" Munro said.\n\nAt least 1,000 trick-or-treaters visit the couple's house each year. In 2007, police had to block off Sandra Drive because so many people came to see the display.\n\n\"The neighbors love it, I think, or they're lying to me,\" Munro said. \"We try to keep it quiet, but one year we had a ghost disco and played disco music every night.

The dead alien was $400, but Munro says it's \"still a member of our family.\"\n\nHe also created a ghost disco (2008), Death Star gas station with Darth Vader (2013) and zombie family (2014), all of which are featured on halloweenlawn.com.\n\nMunro is known around Central New York as the toothpick engineer behind the extravagant Toothpick City displays at the Milton J.

{"text": "[NF] First date\n\nI was nervous. I'm new to this so I had two shots of Captain Morgan before I left, that usually loosens me up. The thought of driving passed my mind more than once but decided to take BART because the restaurant was close enough to walk. I choose my purple plaid shirt because it fits me well. I just bought the blazer so I took it with me even though it clashed. It looks good on me so fuck it, if I fake confidence then maybe she'll mistake it for actual confidence. I looked myself over in the mirror for more time than I care to admit. I hated and loved my outfit more times than I care to admit. I changed clothes and changed back. Decided it was too late to be indecisive so I left. Only to come back and change my shoes.\n   I almost turned around more times than I can count. I rehearsed the excuses in my head, \"I came down with something.\", \"A family emergency came up and they really need me.\", \"Oh, that was today? I'm so sorry! Lets reschedule. No? Ok, then. Bye.\" As much as I dreaded this I was also looking forward to it. She was very pretty from her photos and messaging her was easy. She seemed like a genuine person.  She may have embellished her typed laughter and smiley faces but at least she tried so that in itself had to mean something.\n    By the time my stop came around my palms were sweaty and I was a bit lightheaded, \"Am I doing this again? How many first dates can I have before I realize that a second one is never coming? At least I'll get some food in me.\" As hungry as I was the thought of food made my stomach tighten. I stopped in front of the venue. I thought a rooftop bar would be on the roof. Oh well. I was about to ask about the bar when the doorman said there was room for two more at the elevator. I tried to look like I knew what I was doing as I walked passed him and stood with the group waiting for the elevator door to open.\n    My Tinder account logged me off on BART because of poor reception and I was hesitant to log on in fear that she wouldn't be there when I signed up again. As the door opened in front of me and an actual rooftop bar lay before me I was stuck and overwhelmed. My doubts and fears tripled as I've never been in this type of venue before, \"She's so out of my league that I can't see her with binoculars. This is going to be the shortest date ever. Hope they at least have good appetizers.\"\n    The place was crowded and I couldn't see her. This was made more difficult due to the fact that I had forgotten what she looked like because of nervousness and fear.\n\nI texted her.\n\nNothing.\n\nI texted her again.\n\n5 more minutes and nothing.\n\nI called her.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm here.\"\n\n\"Cool! Where?\"\n\n\"Over by the elevator. I'm wearing a purplish shirt.\"\n\n\"I don't see you.\"\n\nFuck. Really? How hard are you looking? Should I just cut my losses and go?\n\n\"I'm just here by the elevator. There's a chair here I'm sitting on. Where are you?\"\n\n\"Are you sure you're here?\"\n\nNo. I decided to go to the identical rooftop bar next door.\n\n\"Yeah...I think I'm here.\"\n\n\"Let me walk over.\"\n\nI saw her emerge from the gaggle of patrons.\n\nWe locked eyes.\n\nShe smiled.\n\nQuestion: Answer the following question based on the above passage:\n\nSummarize the mounting tension in this story. \n\nAnswer: The mounting tension in this story is that the narrator is purposefully making excuses in his head for cancelling the date at the last minute (such as coming down with something), but both he and the reader can tell that this is only acting out his fears.
